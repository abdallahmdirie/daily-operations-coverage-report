## Architecture Overview

1. Store-level supervisor submits a daily coverage report
2. Basic validation runs (required fields, allowed values)
3. Report is stored centrally for traceability
4. Ops reviews flags and follows up on issues

Design priorities:
- simple, repeatable workflow
- low friction for non-technical users
- audit-friendly record format
